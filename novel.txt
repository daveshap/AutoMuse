Transgalactic flights used to be so boring, that is, until the Obelisk was found. The first hint of it was a sensor ping more than a decade ago, but the crew of that ship dismissed it as a blip. It would be impossible for an object to be several parsecs across. And since they were travelling at relativistic speeds in the intergalactic void, it was difficult to pin down exactly where it was.
But I found it again.
My name is June and I'm an explorer. My ship is called Daedalus and we've been travelling for twenty years. We were the first to find the Obelisk, and we're the only ones who have visited it.
Now that I'm back in my home system, I can't help but feel like something is missing. Like a piece of me is gone. I can't shake the feeling that I've forgotten something important.
I'm going to have to go back.
The Obelisk is a diamond shaped object, about a thousand miles long and half as wide. It's not made of any material we can recognize, but it does have a gravitational field. We've been able to get a few probes and drones close to it, but they've all been destroyed.
We're not sure what the Obelisk is made of, but we think it's organic. It has a magnetic field that seems to be alive, and we've seen some strange things happening at the poles. The only way we can describe them is like auroras, but they don't move like any aurora we've ever seen. They're almost like arms reaching out from the Obelisk.
The Obelisk has been sending out signals for years now, and we still haven't figured out what they mean. We think it's trying to communicate with us in some way, but we just don't know how yet.
I'm going back to find out more about this thing, whatever it is. I have a feeling that if I do this right, I'll be able to make my name as an explorer for years to come." June looked out the window and watched as her home grew closer and closer. It was a tiny speck in the distance, but it had been her home for twenty years. She couldn't wait to see her family again, but she also felt like something was missing.
She tried to shake the feeling off, but it wouldn't go away.
"You okay?" asked one of her crew mates from behind her.
"I'm fine," June replied without turning around. "Just thinking."
"About what?" he persisted, walking up beside her and looking out the window with her.
June sighed and turned to face him before answering his question: "The Obelisk." "The Obelisk?" he asked, confused.
"Yes," she replied. "It's the reason I came out here in the first place."
"I know that, but what about it?"
June turned back to look out the window again and said, "I think it's alive." "I think it's alive," she said, turning back to look out the window.
"What do you mean?" he asked, coming over to stand by her side and looking at it.
She shrugged. "When I was approaching it, before we landed on its surface, I could feel something calling me towards it."
"Have you been getting any strange readings from the obelisk?" he asked.
June thought for a moment and then replied, "No." "I think it's alive," she said, turning back to look out the window.
"What do you mean?" he asked, coming over to stand by her side and looking at it.
She shrugged. "When I was approaching it, before we landed on its surface, I could feel something calling me towards it."
"Have you been getting any strange readings from the obelisk?" he asked.
June thought for a moment and then replied, "No."
