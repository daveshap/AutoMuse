Transgalactic flights used to be so boring, that is, until the Obelisk was found. The first hint of it was a sensor ping more than a decade ago, but the crew of that ship dismissed it as a blip. It would be impossible for an object to be several parsecs across. And since they were travelling at relativistic speeds in the intergalactic void, it was difficult to pin down exactly where it was.
But I found it again.
My name is June and I'm an explorer. My ship is called Daedalus and we've been travelling for twenty years. We were the first to find the Obelisk, and we're the only ones who have visited it.
Now that I'm back in my home system, I can't help but feel like something is missing. Like a piece of me is gone. I can't shake the feeling that I've forgotten something important.
I'm going to have to go back.
The Obelisk is a diamond shaped object, about a thousand miles long and half as wide. It's not made of any material we can recognize, but it does have a gravitational field. We've been able to get a few probes and drones close to it, but they've all been destroyed.
We're not sure what the Obelisk is made of, but we think it's organic. It has a magnetic field that seems to be alive, and we've seen some strange things happening at the poles. The only way we can describe them is like auroras, but they don't move like any aurora we've ever seen. They're almost like arms reaching out from the Obelisk.
The Obelisk has been sending out signals for years now, and we still haven't figured out what they mean. We think it's trying to communicate with us in some way, but we just don't know how yet.
I'm going back to find out more about this thing, whatever it is. I have a feeling that if I do this right, I'll be able to make my name as an explorer for years to come." June's ship, Daedalus, was a small explorer vessel. It had been designed for deep space exploration and had the ability to go into a low-power hibernation mode for long periods of time. The crew consisted of June, her co-pilot and engineer, and two other scientists.
June's ship was the first to find the Obelisk, but it wasn't the only one that had found it. There were several other ships that had detected it as well, but they were all much larger than June's ship. They were also much further away from the Obelisk than she was, so they couldn't get close enough to investigate it.
The Obelisk was sending out signals that we couldn't understand yet. We didn't know what they meant or what they wanted from us. But we knew that whatever it was, it would be something big.
June's crew made their way back to Earth with their findings and reported them to the government. The government then sent out a fleet of ships to investigate the Obelisk more closely and figure out what its intentions were. 'We're not the only ones who have found it,' June said. 'There are other ships that have detected it as well, but they're all much larger than Daedalus and they're all much further away from the Obelisk than we are. They can't get close enough to investigate it.'
'What do you think they want?' asked one of the scientists.
'I don't know,' replied June. 'But I'm sure it's something big.' 'What do you think they want?' asked one of the scientists.
'I don't know,' replied June. 'But I'm sure it's something big.'
June and her crew were in a meeting with the government officials and other scientists to discuss what the Obelisk was and what its intentions were. They had been discussing for hours, but they still didn't know anything about it.
'It's time we sent out a fleet of ships to investigate the Obelisk more closely,' said one of the officials. 'We need to find out what it wants from us.'
'I agree,' said June. 'But I'm not sure how we're going to get close enough without being destroyed by its gravitational field.'
The government officials discussed this for a while before coming up with an idea. They would send out a fleet of ships, but they would be much larger than Daedalus and they would be much further away from the Obelisk than we are. The Daedalus would be able to go closer and investigate it better than any other ship could because it was designed for deep space exploration and had the ability to go into a low-power hibernation mode for long periods of time.
