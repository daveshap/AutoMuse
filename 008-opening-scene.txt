OPENING SCENE:

"I'm going to die," James said, his voice wobbling slightly. "I'm sure of it."
"You're not going to die," John replied, his voice steady. "You're just afraid."
"I'm sorry, John. I know it's my fault."
"No, it's not. There's nothing you could have done."
James stared at his friend, his best friend, for a moment.
"Get the flag," James said.
John nodded.
