June starts to realize that this place is like her home. She has been here before, but she doesn't remember it. It's like the door unlocked something in her head and all of a sudden she remembers what happened before. She remembers walking through the doorway made of light with her crew, but they don't know what's happening because they can't see anything on the other side except for June who seems to be floating in nothingness. They start running after her calling out "June! June!" But then they disappear and she wakes up back in reality on Earth, no longer an explorer but a woman whose children were taken from her long ago by the government.
