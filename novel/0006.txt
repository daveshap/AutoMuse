The crew tries to go on despite warnings, but soon hears somebody yell "I told you not to come back!", causing three trees to stand in front of them again saying "We are sorry for your loss." One says "You have been here before," while the other two add "We can't stop now." The three tall creatures say that they will never be able to leave the Obelisk and they ask June if she wants a second chance at life. She replies yes and gets transported back into reality, this time with her family.
