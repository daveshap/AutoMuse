June and her crew set out in their ship, Daedalus, to go back to the Obelisk. They thought it would be difficult, but when they reached it they found that many people had already come and gone before them. It didn't seem like there was anything worth exploring anymore.

One day while she was exploring the Obelisk on her own (she wasn't sure why) she came upon a doorway made of light. Upon entering this door, she discovered an entirely different world with talking animals and plants which sang when you stepped on them. She started running around trying to explore more of this place until she heard a voice behind her say "I told you not to run." 
All of the sudden there were three tall creatures that looked like trees standing in front of her. One said "We are sorry for your loss." Another added "You have been here before."
