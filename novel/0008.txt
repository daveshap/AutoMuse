June gasped as she remembered the creature's words. "You've been here before." She had always thought that it was just a coincidence, but now her memories were filling in the gaps.

She was with her crew on their first exploration of the Obelisk when they came across a doorway made of light. They went through and found themselves in an entirely different world with talking animals and plants that sing when you step on them. June started running around trying to explore more of this place until she heard a voice behind her say "I told you not to run." All of the sudden there were three tall creatures standing in front of her who looked like trees. One says "We are sorry for your loss," while the other two add "You've been here before." June starts to realize that this place is like her home, she remembers walking through the doorway made of light with her crew, but they don't know what's happening because they can't see anything on the other side except for June who seems to be floating in nothingness. They start running after him calling out "June! June!" But then they disappeared and she wakes up back in reality on Earth, no longer an explorer but a woman whose children were taken from long ago by the government.
