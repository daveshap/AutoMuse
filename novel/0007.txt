June and her crew were exploring the Obelisk and had found a doorway made of light. They soon found themselves in a strange, new world with talking animals and plants that sing when you step on them. June was running around trying to explore this place until she heard a voice behind her say "I told you not to run." All of the sudden there were three tall creatures standing in front of her who looked like trees. One says "We are sorry for your loss," while the other two add "You've been here before." June starts to realize that this place is like her home. She remembers walking through the doorway made of light with her crew, but they don't know what's happening because they can't see anything on the other side except for June who seems to be floating in nothingness. They start running after her calling out "June! June!" But then they disappear and she wakes up back in reality on Earth, no longer an explorer but a woman whose children were taken from her long ago by the government.
