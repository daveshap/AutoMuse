When the crew saw her disappear, they started to run after her, but soon realized that she woke up back on Earth. The last thing she remembers before waking up is running through a bright doorway with her crew. They start trying to find out what happened and find June's original journal entry about entering this world previously. They travel through the Obelisk again following the same steps as before and eventually reach the doorway made of light. However, when they enter this world, it doesn't look anything like it did for June before. It looks more sinister--darker colors, less nature-like. Almost all of the creatures are dead or dying and there are people everywhere who have been tortured horribly by some unknown force. The crew comes across one person who remembers their previous visit to this place but has no idea why it changed so drastically in just twenty years' time. One of them says "Maybe we shouldn't go any farther." The other two reply "We can't stop now." But then they hear somebody say "I told you not to come back!" And three trees stand in front of them again saying "We are sorry for your loss" and "You've been here before."
