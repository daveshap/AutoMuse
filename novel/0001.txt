Transgalactic flights used to be so boring, that is, until the Obelisk was found. The first hint of it was a sensor ping more than a decade ago, but the crew of that ship dismissed it as a blip. It would be impossible for an object to be several parsecs across. And since they were travelling at relativistic speeds in the intergalactic void, it was difficult to pin down exactly where it was.
But I found it again.
My name is June and I'm an explorer. My ship is called Daedalus and we've been travelling for twenty years. We were the first to find the Obelisk, and we're the only ones who have visited it.
Now that I'm back in my home system, I can't help but feel like something is missing. Like a piece of me is gone. I can't shake the feeling that I've forgotten something important.
I'm going to have to go back.
The Obelisk is a diamond shaped object, about a thousand miles long and half as wide. It's not made of any material we can recognize, but it does have a gravitational field. We've been able to get a few probes and drones close to it, but they've all been destroyed.
We're not sure what the Obelisk is made of, but we think it's organic. It has a magnetic field that seems to be alive, and we've seen some strange things happening at the poles. The only way we can describe them is like auroras, but they don't move like any aurora we've ever seen. They're almost like arms reaching out from the Obelisk.
The Obelisk has been sending out signals for years now, and we still haven't figured out what they mean. We think it's trying to communicate with us in some way, but we just don't know how yet.
I'm going back to find out more about this thing, whatever it is. I have a feeling that if I do this right, I'll be able to make my name as an explorer for years to come."
