The crew of Daedalus sets out to explore the Obelisk again. Upon reaching it, they find that many people had already come and gone before them, seemingly leaving nothing worthwhile to explore. One day while exploring the Obelisk on her own, June discovers a doorway made of light. She enters this door and finds an entirely different world with talking animals and plants which sing when you step on them. She starts running around trying to explore more of this place until she hears a voice behind her say "I told you not to run." All of the sudden there are three tall creatures standing in front of her who look like trees. One says "We are sorry for your loss." Another adds "You have been here before."
