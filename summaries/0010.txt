June is in a lab and can't remember what had happened. All she knows is that it was bad because she starts crying when she wakes up. She remembers the dreams from before like they just happened yesterday but also feels like she has been there for years. Suddenly another doctor enters the room, asking questions about who took care of her while she was gone and June doesn't know what he means so he explains that apparently somebody had taken care of her for five years while she was asleep - feeding her, changing clothes, everything! Eventually though June realizes that this person is probably also one of those creatures from before with their warning not to come back - which gives even more credence to their words than before!
