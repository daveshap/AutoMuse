June is an explorer who found the Obelisk. She has been travelling for twenty years and was the first to find it. The Obelisk is a diamond shaped object about a thousand miles long and half as wide, not made of any material we can recognize but with a gravitational field. It sends out signals that we have not figured out what they mean yet.
