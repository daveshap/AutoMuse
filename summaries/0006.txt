June is at the Obelisk with her crew, trying to capture footage of it for a documentary. They are getting warnings not to proceed from the creatures that live there, but they ignore their words and continue on. Nobody else hears the warnings except June, who sees three tall figures appear before them out of nowhere. The three beings say that they have been here before, which scares June's team away after one creature says "We told you not to come back!" After further discussion between themselves about what happened when they were in this place before, two other trees stand up saying "You have been here before" while the third adds "We can't stop now." All three creatures say that they will never be able to leave this spot until someone grants them a second chance at life - which happens when June agrees to let herself be transported back into reality where she has her family waiting for her.
