June's crew are trying to find out what happened when June disappeared. They follow the same steps as before, but this time they find that the world is darker and more sinister than before. On their way, they meet a person who remembers them from their previous visit. The crew attempts to go on despite warnings, but soon hears somebody yell "I told you not to come back!", causing three trees to stand in front of them again saying "We are sorry for your loss" and "You've been here before."
