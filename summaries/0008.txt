June is on an exploration of the Obelisk with her crew when she comes across a doorway made of light. They go through and find themselves in an entirely different world with talking animals and plants that sing when you step on them. June starts running around, but then she hears someone say "I told you not to run." Three tall creatures appear in front of her who look like trees, one says "We are sorry for your loss," while the other two add "You've been here before." June starts to realize this place is like her home, she remembers walking through the doorway made of light with her crew but they don't know what's happening because they can't see anything on the other side except for June who seems to be floating in nothingness. They start running after him calling out "June! June!" But then they disappeared and she wakes up back in reality on Earth.
